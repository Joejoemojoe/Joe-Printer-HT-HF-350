Auto-generated update for toolhead printed out of PEEK.jpg.

### Summary

This photo documents Toolhead Printed Out Of PEEK, focusing on a high-temperature PEEK toolhead. A still frame helps inspect surface quality, part interfaces, and small details without motion blur. The toolhead work here balances mass, stiffness, and thermal management. Cooling duct geometry and fan choice affect overhangs and small-feature fidelity, while weight influences ringing and acceleration limits. Next steps: verify fastener torque, confirm belt tension and tram, then run calibration prints (flow, temperature towers, and input shaping). Any anomalies seen here inform small CAD tweaks or wiring reroutes before finalizing.
