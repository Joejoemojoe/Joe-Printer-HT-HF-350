Auto-generated update for Printer Toolhead Showcase.mp4.

### Summary

This short video documents Printer Toolhead Showcase, focusing on the evolving toolhead assembly. It captures live behavior under real usage, including vibrations, acoustics, and any transient issues that are hard to see in stills. The toolhead work here balances mass, stiffness, and thermal management. Cooling duct geometry and fan choice affect overhangs and small-feature fidelity, while weight influences ringing and acceleration limits. Next steps: verify fastener torque, confirm belt tension and tram, then run calibration prints (flow, temperature towers, and input shaping). Any anomalies seen here inform small CAD tweaks or wiring reroutes before finalizing.
