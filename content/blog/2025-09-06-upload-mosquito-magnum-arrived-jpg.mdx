Auto-generated update for Mosquito magnum+ arrived.JPG.

### Summary

This photo documents Mosquito Magnum+ Arrived.JPG, focusing on a Slice Engineering Mosquito Magnum hotend. A still frame helps inspect surface quality, part interfaces, and small details without motion blur. The Mosquito Magnum is chosen for high flow at elevated temperatures. Mounting focuses on minimizing heat creep while preserving nozzle accessibility and part cooling paths. Next steps: verify fastener torque, confirm belt tension and tram, then run calibration prints (flow, temperature towers, and input shaping). Any anomalies seen here inform small CAD tweaks or wiring reroutes before finalizing.
