Auto-generated update for gantry cad for AWD.jpeg.

### Summary

This photo documents Gantry Cad For AWD, focusing on gantry setup and motion system. A still frame helps inspect surface quality, part interfaces, and small details without motion blur. Structural alignment is checked progressively; squareness and preload on the motion system are adjusted to reduce racking and binding, improving first-layer consistency and dimensional accuracy. CAD iterations here validate envelope clearances, fastener access, and serviceability. Fillets, chamfers, and ribbing are adjusted to manage stress and printability. Next steps: verify fastener torque, confirm belt tension and tram, then run calibration prints (flow, temperature towers, and input shaping). Any anomalies seen here inform small CAD tweaks or wiring reroutes before finalizing.
