### Summary

This photo documents Printed Parts For Printer.JPG, focusing on printed parts fit and finish. A still frame helps inspect surface quality, part interfaces, and small details without motion blur. Next steps: verify fastener torque, confirm belt tension and tram, then run calibration prints (flow, temperature towers, and input shaping). Any anomalies seen here inform small CAD tweaks or wiring reroutes before finalizing.
