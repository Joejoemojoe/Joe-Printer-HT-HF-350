Auto-generated update for CAD to mount Beacon eddy current probe.JPG.

### Summary

This photo documents CAD To Mount Beacon Eddy Current Probe.JPG, focusing on a Beacon eddy-current probe and its mounting. A still frame helps inspect surface quality, part interfaces, and small details without motion blur. The Beacon probe requires rigid mounting and appropriate stand-off. Care is taken to avoid thermal drift and to map bed topology reliably across the build surface. CAD iterations here validate envelope clearances, fastener access, and serviceability. Fillets, chamfers, and ribbing are adjusted to manage stress and printability. Next steps: verify fastener torque, confirm belt tension and tram, then run calibration prints (flow, temperature towers, and input shaping). Any anomalies seen here inform small CAD tweaks or wiring reroutes before finalizing.
