Auto-generated update for Printer with Gantry on.JPG.

### Summary

This photo documents Printer With Gantry On.JPG, focusing on gantry setup and motion system. A still frame helps inspect surface quality, part interfaces, and small details without motion blur. Structural alignment is checked progressively; squareness and preload on the motion system are adjusted to reduce racking and binding, improving first-layer consistency and dimensional accuracy. Next steps: verify fastener torque, confirm belt tension and tram, then run calibration prints (flow, temperature towers, and input shaping). Any anomalies seen here inform small CAD tweaks or wiring reroutes before finalizing.
