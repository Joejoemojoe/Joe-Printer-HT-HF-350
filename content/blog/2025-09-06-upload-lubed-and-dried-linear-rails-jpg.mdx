Auto-generated update for Lubed and dried linear rails.JPG.

### Summary

This photo documents Lubed And Dried Linear Rails.JPG, focusing on linear rail cleaning and lubrication. A still frame helps inspect surface quality, part interfaces, and small details without motion blur. Rails were cleaned and re-lubed to ensure smooth travel. Proper lubricant viscosity and even ball distribution reduce stick-slip and improve input-shaping results. Next steps: verify fastener torque, confirm belt tension and tram, then run calibration prints (flow, temperature towers, and input shaping). Any anomalies seen here inform small CAD tweaks or wiring reroutes before finalizing.
