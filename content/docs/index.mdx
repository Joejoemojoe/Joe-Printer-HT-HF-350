# Getting Started

Welcome to the 3D printer documentation hub. Everything here is stored as Markdown / MDX so you can version control content along with hardware & firmware changes.

## Repository Structure

```text
content/
  docs/       -> Documentation pages (MDX)
  blog/       -> Update / changelog posts (MDX)
src/
  app/        -> Next.js App Router pages & layouts
  components/ -> Reusable React UI pieces
public/       -> Static assets (images)
```

## Features


## Next Steps

Head to the [build guide](/docs/build-guide) to start assembling.

### 3D models

- Put `.glb` or `.gltf` files in `public/models/` (preferred) or `public/uploads/`.
- The homepage hero will auto-detect the first model and render it, spinning.
- STL (`.stl`) is not directly supported in the viewer. Please convert STL to GLB/GLTF (e.g., with Blender: File → Export → glTF 2.0) and place the converted file in `public/models/`.
