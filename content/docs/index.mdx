# Getting Started

Welcome to the 3D printer documentation hub. Everything here is stored as Markdown / MDX so you can version control content along with hardware & firmware changes.

## Repository Structure

```text
content/
  docs/       -> Documentation pages (MDX)
  blog/       -> Update / changelog posts (MDX)
src/
  app/        -> Next.js App Router pages & layouts
  components/ -> Reusable React UI pieces
public/       -> Static assets (images)
```

## Features

- Fast static rendering via Next.js App Router
- GitHub inspired dark theme & layout
- MDX for rich content (React in docs)
- Automatic metadata & reading time
- Shiki highlighted code blocks
- Videos embedding (YouTube, local, MP4)
- Image optimization via Next/Image
