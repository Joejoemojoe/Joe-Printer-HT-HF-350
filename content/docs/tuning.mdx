# Tuning

Good mechanical assembly reduces firmware compensation required.

## Flow Calibration

```text
1. Heat nozzle to print temp
2. Mark filament 120mm above extruder entry
3. Extrude 100mm
4. Measure remaining distance
5. Adjust steps = currentSteps * (commanded / actual)
```

## Input Shaping

Record accelerometer data and feed into your firmware's calculator.

```python
# pseudo example
import numpy as np
raw = np.loadtxt('x-axis.csv', delimiter=',')
# process ...
```

## Pressure Advance / Linear Advance

Print a standardized test tower.

> Document real-world values here after experimentation.
