# Comprehensive Tuning Guide

This guide lays out a pragmatic order of operations for dialing in a high‐performance CoreXY / Voron‑style printer. The goal: eliminate gross mechanical error first, then converge on consistent extrusion and dynamic motion parameters with minimal iterative backtracking.

> Philosophy: Measure → Adjust → Lock‑In → Document. Do not chase cosmetic perfection before foundation steps (squareness, belt symmetry, temps) are stable.

## 1. Mechanical Baseline

Checklist (perform with machine cold & powered off):

- Frame squareness: diagonals within ≤0.5 mm on large panels.
- Gantry coplanarity: rails flush, no rocking; shim only if >0.1 mm gap.
- Belt path symmetry: equal tooth count each loop; tension both sides by frequency (pluck) within ±5 Hz.
- Linear rail smoothness: no gritty spots; relube if dry or draggy.
- Fastener torque: snug, not crushed; recheck after 2 heat cycles.

Only after these are correct move to motion and extrusion calibration.

## 2. Extruder Steps (E-Steps)

Purpose: Make commanded filament advance match reality. Perform at stable real print temperature & with filament that is representative (not brittle old stock).

Procedure:

```text
1. Heat hotend to target (e.g. 240°C for ASA test) and wait 2–3 min soak.
2. Mark filament at 120 mm above extruder entry using a fine marker.
3. Command 100 mm extrusion at slow feed (e.g. 2 mm/s) to avoid skip.
4. Measure remaining distance to the reference point.
5. Actual moved = 120 - remaining.
6. New steps/mm = current * (commanded / actual).
7. Update firmware, store, power cycle, re‑verify (target within ±0.2 mm).
```

If using a gearing change or different drive gears, jump directly to measuring—do not copy someone else’s value unverified.

## 3. Filament Flow (Volumetric / Multiplier)

Even with perfect e‑steps, melt & diameter variance shift effective flow. Calibrate per material family (PLA, PETG, ABS/ASA, Nylon, CF blends).

Test method (Single Wall Cube):

```text
1. Slice a 0 top / 0 infill cube: 40 × 40 × 40 mm, 1 perimeter, layer height 0.2 mm.
2. Disable external modifiers (pressure advance, linear advance, flow overrides).
3. Print slowly (30–40 mm/s walls) at target temperature.
4. Measure wall thickness at 8 evenly spaced points; average.
5. Expected thickness = nozzle_diameter.
6. New flow multiplier = old_multiplier * (expected / measured).
7. Reprint to confirm within ±1%.
```

Log results in a table (material, brand, color, temp, multiplier). Re‑validate when changing batch or after major firmware updates.

## 4. Temperature Towers & Heat Creep Check

Print a temperature tower for each new filament family. Select the temperature band giving:

- Layer fusion (no delamination on flex)
- Minimal stringing
- Clean bridging

Record: brand, color, chosen temp, enclosure temp (if enclosed), fan %.

## 5. Pressure / Linear Advance (Firmware Compensation)

Purpose: Pre‑emptively reduce corner blobbing & infill to wall over‑extrusion by modeling pressure lag in molten filament.

Workflow:

```text
1. Enable pressure/linear advance feature in firmware (K-factor).
2. Slice a standardized calibration pattern (stepped speed lines or tower) with consistent flow (keep multiplier fixed from step 3).
3. Print series sweeping K (e.g. 0.00 → 0.10 in 0.01 increments for direct drive; 0.00 → 0.30 for bowden).
4. Select value with: sharp corners (no over-rounded), no under‑extruded line starts, minimal ripple.
5. Store final K and annotate in your tuning log.
```

Re‑tune only if: nozzle size change, major filament viscosity change, or extruder mechanical revision.

## 6. Resonance / Input Shaping

Measuring vibration allows higher acceleration without ringing.

Options:

- Accelerometer (recommended): Attach properly oriented sensor, run firmware resonance probe for X & Y.
- Test prints: Print ringing towers with incremental accel to visually map onset frequencies (less precise).

If using accelerometer: feed CSV into firmware’s analyzer to generate suggested shaper (e.g. MZV, EI, 2HUMP_EI). Validate with a second pass after applying.

Target: Eliminate noticeable ghosting while retaining acceptable accel (e.g. 8–12k mm/s² for rigid CoreXY frames).

## 7. Retraction & Stringing

After advance + flow stable, dial retraction:

```text
Direct drive typical: 0.4–0.8 mm at 30–50 mm/s
Lightweight bowden: 1.2–2.0 mm at 30–40 mm/s
```

Use a multi‑pillar string test; adjust temperature down slightly if fine hairs persist after optimal retraction.

## 8. Cooling & Overhang Validation

Print an overhang test (every 5°) and a bridging test. Adjust part cooling fan curve (firmware or slicer overrides) so that:

- Critical overhang limit (no severe droop) reached at design goal (≥60° typical).
- Bridges remain flat with minimal sag.

Document fan % and any specialized duct orientation changes.

## 9. First Layer & Bed Mesh Verification

Run bed mesh, inspect deviation map (aim for ≤±0.05 mm after tramming). Print a first layer test grid; adjust Z offset until even satin squish without elephant foot.

## 10. Final Validation Print

Choose a composite benchmark (Benchy, calibration plate, mechanical tolerance test). Record:

- Print time, accel settings
- Surface artifacts remaining (if any)
- Dimensional results (X/Y cube, hole diameters)

Only adjust earlier steps if systematic defect (not isolated random blob) appears.

## Data Logging Template

| Date | Material | Nozzle | Temp | Flow Mult | K / Advance | Retraction | Accel (X/Y) | Shaper | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|--------|-------|
| 2025-09-10 | ASA (Generic Black) | 0.4 | 245°C | 0.97 | 0.045 | 0.6 @ 40 mm/s | 10000 | MZV | Baseline |

## Troubleshooting Quick Table

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix Priority |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Hollow walls / undersize | Flow low or temp too low | Recheck e‑steps & flow, then raise 5°C |
| Corner bulges | Advance K too low or flow high | Tune K, verify multiplier |
| Ringing / ghosting | Accel too high or belts uneven | Balance belts, apply shaping |
| Stringing | Temp high / retraction low | Lower 5–10°C, tune retraction |
| Layer shifts | Loose pulley / skipped steps | Tighten set screws, reduce accel |

## Summary

Lock values in firmware & slicer profiles once stable. Keep a versioned CHANGELOG of tuning changes to correlate print quality shifts with parameter edits.

Happy printing — iterate with data, not guesswork.
