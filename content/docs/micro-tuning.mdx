# Micro Tuning & Quality Diagnostics

This guide targets the last 5-10%: subtle surface artifacts, dimensional drift, and consistency across long print batches. Use only after the main and advanced tuning passes.

## 1. Controlled Change Method

Never tweak multiple levers simultaneously. Structure each experiment:

```
Hypothesis -> Single Parameter Change -> Short Test Artifact -> Measure -> Accept / Revert
```

Keep a CSV or Markdown log (timestamp, parameter, old, new, result, decision). This creates traceability when regressions appear weeks later.

## 2. Surface Artifact Atlas

| Artifact | Visual Cue | Likely Causes | Primary Fix | Secondary Fix |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| Z Banding | Regular horizontal waves | Leadscrew wobble, eccentric coupler, inconsistent layer height | Align & secure couplers; check leadscrew straightness | Bed/gadget vibration isolation |
| Ghosting | Echo of sharp corner | Accel too high, low frame stiffness, poor belt tension | Reduce accel or refine input shaping | Stiffer toolhead, lower moving mass |
| Salmon Skin | Fine tactile ripples | Stepper interpolation artifacts or microstep nonlinearity | Switch driver mode / adjust current | Higher microstep w/ interpolation |
| Underextrusion Blips | Random gaps | Partial clogs, inconsistent filament diameter | Cold pull / nozzle replace | Tight filament path tolerances |
| Blobs / Zits | Dots on seam | Seam alignment & pressure release | Enable linear advance / pressure advance | Alter seam location (rear) |

## 3. Dimensional Calibration (Functional Parts)

Baseline legitimate mechanical accuracy before scaling models:

1. Print a 30 × 30 × 30 calibration cube, 3 perimeters, 0.2 layer, 100% infill. Cool to room temp.
2. Measure X/Y/Z with calipers (+/-0.01 mm). Record shrinkage vs model.
3. If X/Y both off equally: flow or nozzle deflection; if X≠Y: belt tension or pulley set screw.
4. Z error consistent layer-to-layer: verify Z steps/mm (lead vs microsteps).

Avoid slicer “X/Y compensation” until physical causes addressed.

## 4. Hole & Shaft Fit Strategy

Printed circular holes shrink; outer pegs expand.

Rules of thumb (0.4 nozzle, 0.2 layer, PLA/ABS):
- Add +0.15-0.25 mm to hole diameters under 10 mm.
- Subtract ~0.05-0.10 mm from press-fit shaft features.

Always verify with a slot gauge or test fixture instead of tuning by feel.

## 5. Layer Consistency Sampling

Print a tall single-wall tower (e.g., 0.4 nozzle, 0.2 layer, 160 mm height). Use a micrometer to measure wall at 10 mm intervals. Variation >+/-3% suggests intermittent extrusion or thermal fluctuation.

Investigate: filament reel friction, hotend temp oscillation (PID retune), extruder gear cleanliness.

## 6. Temperature Stability Audit

Record hotend temperature at 1 s intervals during a controlled 10 min print segment.

```python
# pseudo snippet
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
t = np.loadtxt('hotend-log.csv', delimiter=',')
print('Mean', t.mean(), 'Δ', t.max()-t.min())
```

Aim for +/-1C band. Wider swings: improve PID tune, add silicone sock, shield from fan blast.

## 7. Filament Batch Consistency

Track flow multiplier per spool. If new spool deviates >3% from baseline:
- Measure filament diameter (8 points). Average <1.74 mm or >1.77 mm? Adjust multiplier.
- Dry hygroscopic filament (PA/PETG) at appropriate temp.

## 8. Noise & Vibration Logging

Accelerometer on the frame while printing a high accel test can reveal emerging mechanical issues (bearing wear, loosening). Save baseline FFT and compare monthly.

## 9. Stringing Micro Test

Use a rapid two‑tower string test script. Evaluate under backlight. If near‑invisible wisps remain but functional parts are clean, stop—diminishing returns.

## 10. Beacon Mesh Drift Spot Checks

After adopting Beacon mesh from advanced guide:

```
1. Print large part (~70% bed area or more).
2. Immediately re-run mesh.
3. Compare delta vs pre-print mesh.
4. If local deviation >0.05 mm emerged check thermal runaway, bed mounting preload, or part-induced warping.
```

## 11. Predictive Maintenance Intervals

| Component | Interval | Check | Action |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| Linear Rails | 200 h | Smooth travel | Clean & re-lube light grease |
| Belts | 150 h | Tension / fray | Retension or replace |
| Hotend Nozzle | 100 h (abrasive: 30 h) | Orifice wear | Replace |
| Extruder Gears | 150 h | Tooth debris | Brush clean |
| Probe (Beacon) | 250 h | Repeatability drift | Re-calibrate |

## 12. Decision Thresholds

Stop tuning and ship the part when:
- Dimensional error <+/-0.15 mm on critical fits (unless aerospace tolerance needed)
- Surface artifacts only visible under raking light
- Functional strength meets test fixture baseline

## Summary

Micro tuning is insurance against creeping regression. Maintain structured logs, minimize guesswork, and reserve deep dives for repeatable, measurable issues.
